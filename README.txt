Did you know you dont have github issues set up?

it is a great way for devs to report issues you know!

Can you make it so i can run ps2 on my r36s clone? i want to plat GTA but cant afford a top of the line device and Temu said this console can play ps2. 

seems like just an over sight on your part tbh.

ALSO!

what about the powerbutton?

5 button presses to turn off is really excessive.

Thanks!
